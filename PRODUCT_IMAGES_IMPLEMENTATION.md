# Product Images Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented product image functionality in your Django e-commerce project with the provided default image URL.

## Default Image URL
The following URL is now used as the default product image when no custom image is uploaded:
```

```

## Changes Made

### 1. Product Model (`mon_projet/products/models.py`)
- Fixed indentation issues
- Added `get_image_url()` method that returns:
  - The uploaded image URL if available
  - The default image URL if no image is uploaded

### 2. URL Configuration (`mon_projet/mon_projet/urls.py`)
- Added media URL configuration to serve uploaded images during development
- Imported necessary modules for static file serving

### 3. Product Views (`mon_projet/products/views.py`)
- Updated `index` view to pass products to the template
- Enhanced `product_dashboard` view to handle file uploads (added `request.FILES`)

### 4. Product Form (`mon_projet/products/forms.py`)
- Added `image` field to the ProductForm to allow image uploads

### 5. Templates

#### Dashboard Template (`mon_projet/templates/products/dashboard.html`)
- Added image column to the product table
- Added CSS styling for product images (80x80px with rounded corners)
- Updated form to handle file uploads (`enctype="multipart/form-data"`)
- Enhanced table styling for better presentation

#### Products Page Template (`mon_projet/templates/products/products.html`)
- Complete redesign with modern card-based layout
- Responsive grid layout for product cards
- Each product card displays:
  - Product image (250px height with cover fit)
  - Product name, description, price
  - Stock information with color coding
- Hover effects for better user experience
- Navigation links to home and dashboard

### 6. API Serializer (`mon_projet/products/serializers.py`)
- Added `image_url` field to the ProductSerializer
- Uses the `get_image_url()` method to provide consistent image URLs in API responses

## Features
1. **Default Image Support**: All products without uploaded images will display the provided perfume image
2. **Image Upload**: Users can upload custom product images through the dashboard
3. **Responsive Design**: Products page uses a modern grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes
4. **API Support**: The REST API includes image URLs for all products
5. **Stock Status**: Visual indicators for in-stock vs out-of-stock products

## Usage
1. **Add Products**: Use the dashboard to add new products with or without images
2. **View Products**: Visit the products page to see all products in a modern card layout
3. **API Access**: Use the `/products/api/` endpoint to get product data including image URLs

## Dependencies Installed
- Django 5.2.4
- Django REST Framework 3.16.0
- Pillow 11.3.0 (for image handling)
